In Section 9.4, Huffman Trees are introduced and the Huffman’s algorithm to construct a Huffman tree is discussed. In this project you will implement the Huffman’s algorithm to define a Huffman code for a given English text.
Write a program that constructs a Huffman code for a given English text and encode it. The English character occurrence probabilities can be computed from the given text.
Experiment with your encoding program to find a range of typical compression ratios for Huffman’s encoding of English texts of, say, 1000 words.
Experiment with your encoding program to find out how sensitive the compression ratios are to using standard estimates of frequencies instead of actual frequencies of character occurrences in English texts.
Write a program for decoding an English text that has been encoded with a Huffman code. You can design your way to communicate the English character occurrence probabilities
